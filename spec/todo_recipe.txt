{{PROBLEM}} Method Design Recipe
1. Describe the Problem
As a user
So that I can keep track of my tasks
I want to check if a text includes the string #TODO.


2. Design the Method Signature
todo returns true is string contains #TODO
bool = todo(str)
bool: a boolean of the result of the test.
str: a string containing the text to test.

There are no side effects of this method


3. Create Examples as Tests

todo("") => false
todo("This is a string with nothing to do") => false
todo("I need #TODO pass this challenge") => true
todo(nil) => throw error
todo(!String) => throw error
