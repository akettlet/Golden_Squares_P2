{{PROBLEM}} Class Design Recipe
1. Describe the Problem
As a user
So that I can keep track of my music listening
I want to add tracks I've listened to and see a list of them.


2. Design the Class Interface

class music
  def initalize()
    @list = []
  end

  def add(artist, track)
    #add artist and track to list as an array
  end

  def list()
    #return list of tracks as string
  end
end

3. Create Examples as Tests

# 1
music = Music.new
music.add("Lizzo", "About Damn Time")
music.list() # => "About Damn Time by Lizzo"

# 2
music = Music.new
music.add("", "About Damn Time") => throw error Need to pass an artist


# 3
music = Music.new
music.add("Lizzo", "") => throw error Need to pass a track

# 4
music = Music.new
music.add("Lizzo", "About Damn Time")
music.add("BLACKPINK", "Pink Venom")
music.list() # => "About Damn Time by Lizzo\nPink Venom by BLACKPINK"
